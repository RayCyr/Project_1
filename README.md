### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly "available," in addition to restricting "overload" to the network.

Load balancers protect "Availablity" 

The advantage of a jump box is that a jumpbox allows for the secure adminstration of web servers.  

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.

Filebeat watches for changes to files and when the changes were done.

-Metricbeat records metrics from the operating system and from services running on a server.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
