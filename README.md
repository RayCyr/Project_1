**Project 1**

**Project contains the following:**
1) Cloud Security Project


2) Linux Configuration Scripts 

    *(I posted what I had; however, due to having to rebuild my system earlier some time after/or during the Linux modules, I don't have more scripts to provide      with my project. A recommendation that I would like to pass on regarding future cohorts, is if a similar project is going to require scripts from a VM that      has a history of having to be rebuilt, that future students would strongly  be encouraged to save their configuration scripts for a future project. I was        among several students that had to rebuild their machines at least once during the boot camp. If my recommendation was communicated then I stand corrected      and apologize for this unnecessary feedback. I will edit this once my project is graded as I understand the purpose for this submission is a repository          that could be used for future employment)*
    
 3) Network Diagrams (Other than the network diagram for cloud security)
