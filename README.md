**Project 1**

**Project contains the following:**

1) Linux configuration scripts 

    *(I posted what I had; however, due to having to rebuild my system earlier some time after/or during the Linux modules, I don't have more scripts to provide      with my project. A recommendation that I would like to pass on regarding future cohorts, is if a similar project is going to require scripts from a VM that      has a history of having to be rebuilt, that future students would strongly  be encouraged to save their configuration scripts for a future project. I was        among several students that had to rebuild their machines at least once during the boot camp. If my recommendation was communicated then I stand corrected      and apologize for this unnecessary feedback.)*
