### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly **available**, in addition to restricting **overload** to the network.

Load balancers protect **availablity** 

The advantage of a jump box is that a jumpbox allows for the **secure adminstration of web servers.**  

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.

Filebeat watches for changes to files and when the changes were done.

-Metricbeat records metrics from the operating system and from services running on a server.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
